            My name is Aiman Kassam. I am a student enrolled at the University of Guelph studying computer engineering, I am also enrolled in the co-op program! I have a passion for programming and I am currently seeking an internship as a junior developer. This page itself will be a showcase of my skill in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as all the code going into this page is done by me personally! You will read about my work and academic experiences, my programming skills, and any projects I have to show them!
