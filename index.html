                My name is Aiman Kassam. I am a student enrolled at the University of Guelph studying computer engineering, I am also enrolled in the co-op program. I have a passion for programming and I am currently seeking an internship as a junior developer. This page itself will be a showcase of my skill in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as all the code going into this page is done by me personally. You will read about my work and academic experiences, my programming skills, and any projects I have to show them.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I am currently employed at Maple Lodge Farms, and have been since April of 2021. Within the company, I report to two supervisors whom I each have separate responsibilities for. My two sets of responsibilities are to support maintenance on the digital side and to assist our maintenance team with repairing and installing light fixtures throughout the plant and office areas. Certain skills I have used to deliver on my responsibilities effectively are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organizational skills</strong> - Preventative maintenance work is distributed as printouts of instructions associated with a machine. I must generate and distribute PMs in an organized manner such that whoever's responsible for maintaining a machine receives the corresponding PMs &#40e.g. electrical, mechanical and refrigeration must be separate, and may be further separated by which plant the machine belongs to&#41. When returned upon completion, I close all PM work orders in our database, create follow-on work orders based on any faulty conditions found to allow maintenance to rectify the situation.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication</strong> - Certain jobs to be done require parts to be ordered ahead of time, or contractors to assist with the labour requirements of the job. Each of these are processed via material lists, which I process. When given a material list from a maintenance foreman, I create instances of the parts in our database, assign them to work orders, and manage communications between the maintenance and purchasing departments to ensure parts are delivered on time, and to ensure rush order parts are being expedited.</li>
                <li><strong>Independent Work</strong> -</li>
            </ul>
