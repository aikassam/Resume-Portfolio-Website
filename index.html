            My name is Aiman Kassam. I am a student enrolled at the University of Guelph studying computer engineering, I am also enrolled in the co-op program! I have a passion for programming and I am currently seeking an internship as a junior developer. This page itself will be a showcase of my skill in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as all the code going into this page is done by me personally! You will read about my work and academic experiences, my programming skills, and any projects I have to show them!

            Academic Experience
        </h2>
        <p>
            In my enrollment at the University of Guelph, I have gained considerable technical knowledge and had the opportunity to put them into practice. Below are technical areas I have practiced and/or gained knowledge in through my academics:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Structures</strong> - In completing the Data Structures course, I have learned about the many data structures for storing data &#40linked lists, hash-tables, stacks, etc.&#41. The varying time and space complexities of each data structure and its methods plays a crucial role in determining how data should be stored in websites/applications. A hash-table works much better for accessing a website user's information from a database using their login, as opposed to a linked list which would have to iterate through all users to find your information.</li>
                <li><strong>Programming in C</strong> - The Introduction to Programming for Engineers course taught me the basics of programming in C. The covered concepts included loops and conditionals, arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operators, functions, etc. A year later taking the Data Structures course, I strengthened the previously mentioned skills in C, while also utilizing pointers to implement data stuctures such as linked lists, and memory management.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming in Java</strong> - </li>
                <li><strong>Probability and Statistics</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Modelling Systems</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
