                Academic Experience
            </h2>
            <p>In my enrollment at the University of Guelph, I have gained considerable technical knowledge and had the opportunity to put them into practice. Below are technical areas I have practiced and/or gained knowledge in through my academics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Structures</strong> - In completing the Data Structures course, I have learned about the many data structures for storing data &#40linked lists, hash-tables, stacks, etc.&#41. The varying time and space complexities of each data structure and its methods plays a crucial role in determining how data should be stored in websites/applications. A hash-table works much better for accessing a website user's information from a database using their login, as opposed to a linked list which would have to iterate through all users to find your information.</li>
                <li><strong>Programming in C</strong> - The Introduction to Programming for Engineers course taught me the basics of programming in C. The covered concepts included loops and conditionals, arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operators, functions, etc. A year later taking the Data Structures course, I strengthened the previously mentioned skills in C, while also utilizing pointers to implement data stuctures such as linked lists, and memory management.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming in Java</strong> - During the Winter 2023 semester, I took the Object-Oriented Programming course which taught the fundamental concepts of OOP. Through assignments done for the course, I learned about the conventions for set/get methods on objects, about inheritance and polymorphism being used to create like-objects with overridden and individualized traits and methods. Learning OOP taught me to abstract concepts when possible to object methods to provide more readable and modular code.</li>
                <li><strong>Probability and Statistics</strong> - As one of the most applicable areas of study in mathematics, I particularly enjoyed learning about probability and statistics. Some of the concepts I learned include probability theory, Bayes' Theorem, normal distributions and standard deviations, and linear regression. During this course, I used the knowledge I learned to write a paper that explains probability theory and Bayes' Theorem extensively using the LaTeX markup language, which can be found <a href = "STAT_2120_Written_Assignment__1___Aiman_Kassam.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Learning about linear regression led to an interest in regression algorithms to create predictive models using Python data science libraries, such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.</li>
                <li><strong>Modelling Systems</strong> - After taking courses in linear algebra and system modelling, I have learned skills to model systems encompassing an incredibly wide variety (traffic flow, circuits, thermal systems, and more). Systems we were tested to mathematically model included systems of equations and matrices to group information together, differential equations to model how the state of a system changes, principle component analysis to determine which components of a system play the most significant role with them, and many more.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>University does not only teach you the content of the courses you take, but also many more transferrable skills to succeed in multiple courses and cater to various forms of assessment. Here I have listed practical skills I have strengthened in my time at the University of Guelph:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time management</strong> - Meeting deadlines within each course; managing time between all 6 of my courses; splitting my responsibilities between full-time work, full-time school, and the gym; these are all tasks I have been faced with on a daily basis. In order to stay on top of my responsibilities, effective strategies for distributing the time have to be implemented. In equal importance to effective strategies, I must reflect on any strategy that proves ineffective and fine tune it to my needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Working under pressure</strong> - Timed examinations are the most common form of major assessments in university. It is typical for professors to make examinations worth anywhere from 40-90% of your entire grade in their course. In order to succeed in school, I have been repeatedly tasked with performing adequately to course expectations and have met the standards placed time and time again.</li>
